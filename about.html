          <h2>Story of PlayStation®</h2>
          <p>
            The first PlayStation console was released in Japan in December
            1994, and worldwide the following year. The original console in the
            series was the first console of any type to ship over 100 million
            units, doing so in under a decade. Its successor, the PlayStation 2,
            was released in 2000; it is the best-selling home console to date,
            having reached over 155 million units sold by the end of 2012.
            Sony's next console, the PlayStation 3, was released in 2006,
            selling over 87.4 million units by March 2017. Sony's next console,
            the PlayStation 4, was released in 2013, selling a million units
            within a day, becoming the fastest selling console in history. The
            latest console in the series, the PlayStation 5, was released in
            2020 and sold 10 million units in its first 249 days, unseating its
            predecessor as the fastest-selling PlayStation console to-date. The
            main series of controllers utilized by the PlayStation series is the
            DualShock, a line of vibration-feedback gamepads that sold 28
            million units by June 2008.
